    * Compile the program using the bash compile.sh:<br>
      [WEEKLY PROBLEMS]
      ```shellscript
      [your-disk]:[name-path]> sh compile.sh [name-of-the-file-without-.cpp]
      ```
      [PROJECT PROBLEMS]
      ```shellscript
      [your-disk]:[name-path]> sh compile.sh
      ```
    * Finally just run it:<br>
      [WINDOWS]
      ```shellscript 
      [your-disk]:[name-path]> [executable].exe < [test-file]
      ```
      [LINUX]
      ```shellscript 
      [your-disk]:[name-path]> ./[executable] < [test-file]
      ```
